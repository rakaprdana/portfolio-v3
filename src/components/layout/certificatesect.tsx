        "I created a web application utilizing full-stack technologies, prioritizing enhanced user experience and optimal performance. Working collaboratively within a team, I played an active role in designing, developing, and testing innovative software solutions that addressed user requirements. I crafted responsive and intuitive interfaces using Figma, ensuring compatibility across various devices. By integrating frontend tools like React TypeScript (ReactTS) and TailwindCSS with backend frameworks such as Express, I developed high-performing and scalable web applications. Furthermore, I managed non-relational databases like MongoDB and implemented RESTful APIs to enable smooth communication between frontend and backend systems.",
